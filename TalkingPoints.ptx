                <p><pretext /> (<url href="https://pretextbook.org/" />)
                  is a free authoring platform for creating the next
                  generation of open textbooks in a variety of
                  formats from a single source. This article outlines some of the
                  advantages of <pretext /> and reasons to consider adopting

              <term>Open Educational Resources</term> (<init>OER</init>)
              have been growing in popularity among post-secondary faculty concerned
              with affordability of textbooks and other materials they ask their
              students to purchase. However, affordability alone is not a sufficient
              reason for an instructor to choose a particular textbook: quality and
              alignment with curriculum remain important considerations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many early <init>OER</init> examples were free, both in
              terms of cost and licensing, but they could not compete with commercial
              textbooks on visual appeal, resources, and overall quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <pretext /> project is an attempt to capture the best of both worlds:
              <ul>
                <li>Free <mdash /> or minimal <mdash /> cost for students.</li>
                <li>Open licensing allowing work to be freely distributed,
                  shared, revised, remixed, and retained.</li>
                <li>Visibly high quality layout and presentation.</li>
                <li>Availability in a variety of formats and platforms.</li>
                <li>Support for interactivity, supplemental resources, and more.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              At its most basic <pretext /> is a markup language
              for textbook authoring that will look familiar to  anyone used to
              <init>HTML</init> or <m>\LaTeX</m>.
              The particular tags used to indicate different parts of the document
              are different, but the underlying idea is the same.
              The advantage of <pretext /> over other markup languages you may be
              familiar with is that <pretext /> can be automatically converted into
              a variety of outputs, including:
              <ul>
                <li><init>HTML</init></li>
                <li><init>PDF</init> (via <m>\LaTeX</m>)</li>
                <li>Print</li>
                <li>ePub</li>
                <li>Jupyter notebooks</li>
                <li>Braille</li>
              </ul>
              The <pretext /> system is completely free and open, and supported by a
              welcoming community of <init>OER</init> enthusiasts, authors,
              educators, and developers.

              The remainder of this article describes the basic technical structure of <pretext />,
              its advantages for authors, instructors, and students, and some of the exciting
              features that members of the <pretext /> community are working to develop.

            <title>Technical Details</title>

            <p>
              What, exactly, is <pretext />? The core of <pretext /> is an
              <init>XML</init> vocabulary that describes the structure of a
              textbook: chapters, sections, examples, exercises, and so forth.
              Knowledge of this vocabulary is sufficient to author a document in <pretext />.
              To <em>publish</em> in <pretext />; that is, to produce a usable document from
              an author's source, there are processing tools provided to convert the
              <pretext /> source into a variety of formats.
            </p>
            <p>
              At present, the processing tools require a reasonable level of technical ability
              with command-line tools in a Unix-like environment, but tools are under
              development to allow for easier processing, including support for Windows, a
              <init>GUI</init> for configuration, and one-click processing.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="section-authors">
            <title>Advantages for Authors</title>

            <p>
              The primary reason <ndash /> and original motivation <ndash />
              is the ability to <q>write once, and read anywhere</q>; that is,
              to produce a variety of formats from a single source.
              Another advantage is the fully open nature of the platform. Getting
              started does involve a technical learning curve, but it does not
              require an account, or subscription, or licensing fee, unlike other
              <q>open</q> platforms such as Pressbooks.
            </p>

            <p>
              For authors who are familiar with authoring content in <m>\LaTeX</m>,
              the step to <pretext /> is a relatively small one. Equations and other
              mathematical content are produced using familiar <m>\LaTeX</m> syntax,
              and the document structure will look familiar to anyone who has
              written in <init>HTML</init>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <pretext /> system was created for authors, by authors who wanted the
              ability to accomplish more than is possible with traditional authoring
              systems such as <m>\LaTeX</m>. In addition to logical layout and content
              structure, <pretext /> provides the ability to integrate multimedia elements
              such as videos, applets, and interactive homework exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <pretext /> community also provides an invaluable resource for authors.
              Questions posted to the <pretext /> support Google group typically receive
              same day responses from dedicated experts.
            </p>

        <section xml:id="section-instructors">
            <title>Advantages for Instructors</title>
            <p>
              A big advantage of <pretext /> from an instructor's point of view is
              <em>accessibility</em>. A <pretext /> book is accessible in numerous ways:
              <dl>
                <li>
                  <title>Financial accessibility</title>
                  <p>
                   <init>HTML</init>,
                <init>PDF</init> and ePub versions can be freely
                distributed to students.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>Timely accessibility</title>
                  <p>
                  The textbook can be made available
                  online to students at any time<mdash />including before the
                  first class.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>Diverse accessibility</title>
                  <p>
                    The <init>HTML</init> output from <pretext /> is designed
                  with access for differently-abled persons as a primary goal.
                  Devices like screen readers are supported, even for mathematical content.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </dl>
            </p>
            <p>
              Another advantage <ndash /> or reassurance <ndash /> for instructors is the
              availability of textbooks authored in <pretext /> that are high quality,
              visually appealing, and course-tested.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the ability to include interactive and multimedia elements
              <em>directly in the textbook</em> means that instructors can provide students
              with <em>structured interaction</em>: rather than having students navigate to
              multiple locations to access videos, interactive elements, <etc />,
              everything the students need can be organized, and integrated, in one place.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="section-students">
            <title>Advantages for Students</title>
            <p>
              For students, <pretext /> provides ease of access: access to course materials
              for free, at any time time, on any device. The <init>HTML</init> output
              from <pretext />, unlike <init>PDF</init>, automatically reconfigures
              itself for use on smaller screens such as smartphones.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <pretext /> textbook provides a simplified interface for students. All the
              content they need for their course is in one place, including text, videos, and
              homework problems. Moreover, these can be integrated in a way that makes it easy
              for students to find the content they need to complete their homework problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, the content in a <pretext /> book goes beyond a traditional print
              textbook, to include videos, interactive homework and graphics, and live
              computational tools via <term>Sage</term> cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, a <pretext /> book is made available to a student for free, forever.
              A student in subsequent courses does not need to worry about being able to
              access the textbook from their prerequisite courses when they need to review
              a concept. The open licensing of a <pretext /> book promises that a student's
              copy is theirs for as long as they want it.
            </p>

        <section xml:id="section-future">
            <title>Future Progress</title>
            <p>
              As a relatively new project, some may view <pretext /> as having a disadvantage
              compared to mature platforms like <m>\LaTeX</m> in terms of ease of use.
              However, there is also a major advantage: <pretext /> is undergoing rapid,
              continual development, with new features being added on a regular basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the exciting features under current development include:
              <dl>
                <li>
                  <title>Analytics</title>
                  <p>
                    A group of instructors interested in the Scholarship of Teaching
                    and Learning have already participated in a pilot project where
                    analytic tools were embedded into the online version of the textbook
                    so that those instructors could track how and when their students
                    were using the book.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>Annual editions</title>
                  <p>
                    Support for authors to track and highlight changes and improvements
                    in their textbooks on a yearly release schedule.
                    Adopters and instructors would be able to see at a glance what changes
                    were made to the textbook from one year to the next.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>Student logins</title>
                  <p>
                    An infrastructure layer <ndash /> added onto the <init>HTML</init>
                    version of the textbook <ndash /> would provide students with a persistent
                    login token, allowing them to make notes, save answers to reading questions,
                    and highlight important passages, all without leaving the textbook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, an instructor logging into the book has the ability
                    to view (and in principle, grade) all of the student responses.
                    Although this feature has not been publicly released, it has been
                    successfully trialled in the past year.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>Instructor Editions</title>
                  <p>
                    In addition to an instructor login, as described above, it will soon
                    be possible for an author to create an <em>instructor edition</em> of
                    a textbook, which would include additional notes for the instructor
                    on best practices for teaching content within the book.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>Ancillary Material</title>
                  <p>
                    Another feature being planned for instructor editions is the ability
                    to associate ancillary material, such as exercises, videos, tests, <etc />.
                    Some of these materials, such as videos, could be made available to students,
                    if thet are not already part of the textbook.
                  </p>

                <li>
                  <title>Installation and Processing Tools</title>
                  <p>
                    A working Windows installer was demonstrated at a recent <pretext />
                    workshop in Portland, OR; at that same workshop, a team was working
                    on developing support in the <term>TeXShop</term> application for Mac
                    computers to allow for editing and one-click processing of <pretext />
                    documents. The goal is to provide a user experience for <pretext />
                    that is similar to what modern <m>\LaTeX</m> users are used to.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>
                    Worksheets and Jupyter
                  </title>
                  <p>
                    Support for worksheets is very close to being considered part of
                    <pretext /> <em>present</em>, rather than <pretext /> future.
                    Worksheets, which could be intended for self-study or as an
                    in-class assignment (<eg /> for a tutorial/recitation/discussion),
                    can be included as part of a textbook, or created as an external
                    document, whether as a standalone worksheet, or as part of a
                    workbook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is already support for conversion to Jupyter in <pretext />,
                    but this conversion preserves much of the styling in <pretext />
                    and is not ideal for creation of materials such as lab assignments.
                    On the plus side, Sage Cell interactive elements are automatically
                    converted to Jupyter code cells already.
                    A simplified Jupyter conversion is being planned to allow for
                    easy authoring of <pretext /> worksheets for Jupyter.

                  <title>Slides</title>
                  <p>
                    For instructors who like to (or have to) lecture from slides,
                    <pretext /> will soon offer the ability to produce lecture slides
                    in two different ways. One will be to directly process parts of a
                    <pretext /> book into slides. The other will be to directly author
                    slides using <pretext />. In either case, the slides can be
                    served in a web browser using <term>reveal.js</term> or in PDF
                    via conversion to <m>\LaTeX</m> <term>Beamer</term>.

                  <title><init>LMS</init> integration</title>
                  <p>
                    A longer term goal for <pretext /> is to develop the ability to
                    integrate a <pretext /> book with Learning Management Systems such
                    as Canvas or Moodle. In principle, this would allow instructors to
                    easily record scores for elements such as reading questions, and
                    hopefully, for students to be able to complete online homework
                    questions for credit, without having to leave the textbook.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </dl>
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, what a project like <pretext /> demonstrates is that,
              when considering options for course materials, an instructor can choose
              an Open Education Resource for their students, not just because it is
              cheaper than an equivalent commercial resource, but because it is
              <em>better</em> than any equivalent commercial resource.

              In the near future, a <pretext /> book will be able to serve as a
              one-stop shop for everything related to a course, from the text,
              to videos, to handouts, to graded homework.
              A <pretext /> book is portable, accessible, interactive, and free.
              The features it can include are increasing by the day.
